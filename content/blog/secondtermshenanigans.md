I’ve been creating PR materials for student council hopefuls for seven years. Halfway through college, I have expanded my clientele throughout Manila’s University Belt. It was my entry ticket to campus politics, where I’ve created a loose network of student leaders in dire need of creative assistance.

Campaigns and elections in the University start anytime between March and April. Inside the campus, I worked exclusively with former affiliates of Alyansa ng Kristyanong Lakas (AKLAS), a defunct University central political party. For clients outside the University, communication is relatively simple. Most transactions happen online due to location restraints. However, I personally give the deliverables to prevent them from running away without payment. I get clients through referrals and word of mouth, and I don’t accept offers from politicians for personal reasons.

I once thought that campus politics was a weird clique that I’ll eventually move on as I progress through college. Unfortunately, it opened room for deeper involvement. The abstain fiasco of 2017 was a personal turning point that made me realize that systems can be bent for the interests of the few. No wonder many people kept remarking that college is a microcosm of society — University life is just as accursed as the greater scheme of things.

There’s a lot of things to talk about, but here are some of my observations and nitpicks as a former student.

## Modernizing systems

Documents such as the UST Students’ Election Code of 2011 (USEC 2011) and the Central Student Council (CSC) constitution remain unchanged as of writing. While the proliferation of independent candidates in CSC polls can be attributed to many factors, the COMELEC’s stringent requirements on political party registration must be reassessed in order to keep up with the University’s political landscape. Some independent candidates in recent years receive support from defunct parties — a fact high-ranking student leaders, including those from COMELEC, are fully aware of. A functioning party system in the University will benefit both the party and the electorate. Party members will be able to express full support without fear of COMELEC sanctions while students will be able to add an additional repertoire with regards to decision-making in the elections.

With the recent revisions of the UST Students’ Handbook and the Student Organizations Coordinating Council (SOCC) constitution, CSC’s constitution should be revisited as well. If structural changes are to be made, a consensus must be reached before implementing such changes. After all, councils serve the student body.

I also think Student Affairs should hire more people. They’re hugely understaffed for handling more or less 150 student organizations. It’s a win-win for both parties — inquiries of students are entertained faster while the workload is significantly lessened because it’s distributed to more people.

## Strengthening accountability measures

I’ve seen officials from different campuses get away with accountability through resignation. Allegedly misappropriated funds? Resignation tendered. Project ended poorly? Resignation tendered. Can’t live up to promises made during the campaign period? Resignation tendered.

No wonder SCs have a reputation for being dirty — shitty people get away with poor leadership.

“But Rabin, there’s a section for impeachment in X organization. Why are you telling us that a mechanic doesn’t exist?” Well, yes, there are accountability measures. However, are we getting officers impeached? Article XII of the CSC Constitution mentions the word “impeach” (and its variations) five times, and it doesn’t even tell you how to initiate impeachment procedures! No wonder why we’re not kicking incompetent asses legally kicked out of office.

## Templated responses

Do you have a problem? Write a letter and address this to X office. We won’t talk to them for you; just submit your complaints, and you’ll probably hear from them in a few business days. Or weeks. Or months. You’re an org of Y nature, so you guys should work the same way as Z org, right? What do you mean we didn’t do anything? We submitted the letter for you, so you should be grateful!

Solutions don’t appear in thin air, so there should be an effort to craft one carefully. Moreover, it should be data-driven. It would be a waste to ask the students about their thoughts on tuition fee increase and not do anything about their answers, right?

## Veritas in Caritate

A platform that never ceases to appear during election season is transparency report initiatives. For the most part, these platforms are concerned about the financial aspect of the SC, which is expected from public officials to begin with. However, there are things that we vaguely know about.

Almost every CSC presidential candidate that I’ve witnessed has mentioned the ever-pending UST Students’ Code, but there’s no constant update about its progress. If you know someone inside a SC, you might hear details about its progress. But for those who choose not to dabble with extra-curricular activities, the Students’ Code remains a second semester buzzword. While there have been public discussions about the said document, more effort needs to be exerted to consolidate support from the student body. Every student should know about the Students’ Code and its progress.

## Same old practices

The continuity of personality politics remains unshaken. SC culture feels like a weird cult. Some candidates (and officers) offer little to no improvement in the current state of affairs. Imagine making a platform that’s already within the bounds of your constitutional duties. It’s like advertising bottled water and telling people that it quenches thirst. Moreover, activities such as outreach programs, scheduling techniques, and equipment lending programs already exist in a specific capacity, so if they’re not improving anything significant, why bother reintroducing the same concept? Some platforms are so mundane that I wonder how it passed some form of SWOT analysis.

Here are some campaign platforms I’ve seen that barely scratch the surface:

1. Scheduling initiatives: There are efforts to integrate services such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Teams to inform students about college events and to allegedly alleviate student workloads. This is not unique, almost every major corporation does this on a specific scale. While this is an additional avenue for information dissemination, it won’t help lessen workloads.
Mental health seminars: No brainer. This has been lobbied since God knows when, but students from all walks of life still suffer from academically-induced mental stress. We need to up the ante by changing the system if we want university life to be less taxing.

2. Websites: If you don’t have plans to fairly compensate developers (especially if created by in-house student devs), then don’t bother creating one at all.

3. Infographics: Kelangan mo ba talaga tumakbo sa council para gawin yan?

On the other hand, political discourse has steadily improved within party circles. As national politics encroach personal spaces and freedoms, the need to represent and safeguard the student body becomes imminent. Moreover, the rise of Twitter cancel culture reminded those in position that SC officers are not the invisible gods they thought they were. However, discourse is worthless if policymaking remains stagnant. *Walk the talk, kumbaga.*

It’s wrong to label SCs as “dead.” Technically, University-wide events such as the Paskuhan festivities and the Baccalaureate Mass are manifestations of student politics. However, if these governing bodies are known only for prestigious collegiate activities, something’s wrong with their foundations. They’re not glorified events management services, to begin with.

We don’t expect things to drastically change for the next five years. However, if we continue to cling to the politics of the old, students’ futures will remain uncertain.
