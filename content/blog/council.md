Of all the strategy games I’ve played, nothing beats a one-more-turn session of Civilization 6. Imagine chess, but instead of black-and-white squares and feudal icons, you nurture an ancient civilization from sticks to thermonuclear bombs in a randomly generated world placed on a hex grid.

In a game of Civ, the civilization that stands the test of time claims victory. You can be a savior by establishing a one-world religion. Too dogmatic? Try diplomacy, United Nations style. Of course, when all attempts become futile, you can make it rain with bombs and stuff like that.

Of course, I have no intentions of emulating what I do in Civ. I am not willing to be an actor of state violence. I have no interest in evangelization. Foreign policy and diplomacy is probably the last profession I’d consider pursuing. However, Civ brings out the grand strategist in me. I like thinking about ten steps forward. Trivial or not, strategizing makes me firm about my decisions. The last thing that I want to happen is reaping the consequences of a miscalculated decision.

Unfortunately, I made a miscalculation.

I joined a university-wide council. No, not the usual student council that makes its candidates wander around campus and shake the hands of the electorate. Instead, consensus happens in a closed-door session between student representatives. It’s a council that supposedly regulates and “supports” student organizations.

Before my appointment, I was undergoing a transition stage to be the president of another organization. Back then, I was approaching my fourth year in the org, so I knew what I wanted to do. Leading a digital media organization with a publication-like structure is foreign to a computer science student who barely knows Journalism 101, so I had to be twenty steps ahead.

I knew what I was doing. At least that’s what I thought. Now, back to the council story.

I was appointed executive secretary. With such a small time frame I was given before finalizing my decision, all I wanted was to change particular aspects of the “org-life” that were erroneous and redundant. Especially when you are part of a media organization that keeps on producing critical narratives, things get rough pretty quickly.

The org-life gave me opportunities to work with different people. Within the council, I had to work alongside student leaders who were somewhat in the same aptitude as I am — leaders of their organizations with different perspectives on things I am not allowed to speak of. My college peers knew I got involved in politics during student council elections. Still, I never had the chance to apply “council theory” until my appointment.

Council work is mostly policymaking and negotiation. I have been told to compromise to make things work. It was deemed a sacred technique utilized by particular council heads to further their agendas that were allegedly for their constituents. I find compromise necessary for things like event planning or even funding, given that the compromise constitutes a fair deal between the two parties. However, how the hell do I compromise editorial independence? How should I make censorship and social media policing palatable to the censored and the policed?

I faced such a conundrum for the entirety of my term. It feels unnatural to challenge the dominant narrative on one end and uphold the status quo on the other. While I am confident that I did not harm any organization, I also feel remorse because all I had to offer was dissent — and we all know that dissent is moot without materialization in the greater scheme of things.

I also experienced short bursts of alienation. There is persistence to make grades a measure of student-led leadership. As a (former) irregular student, an environment that upholds such standard is disheartening. A-star students do not guarantee a student-first approach, either way. This perspective deserves another opinion piece of its own. Still, I am a staunch believer in abolishing grades as a criterion for such positions. I felt like an outcast in a governing body that is supposed to unite its constituents in one way or another.

To give the council credit, it does not have malicious intentions. However, it has chosen to be quiet when specific circumstances arise. All it does is churn out layers upon layers of bureaucracy for the most part. Especially in today’s context where organizational room meetings are replaced with Zoom conferences, there is an immediate need to address vulnerabilities within the organizational life cycle.

While there is massive potential for progressive policymaking and lobbying, the council and its board have yet to realize the strength of its bargaining power — a facet of student governance mastered by their elected-at-large council counterparts. It should train itself to strengthen consensus among its constituents. It should be willing to understand the nuances of different organizations to formulate specific solutions for specific issues. A templated response not only provides half-assed results but also disrespects those affected by unfortunate circumstances.

Most of the actions players do in Civ can be dismissed as alternate history, but it gets one thing right — empires fall, no matter how tall they rise. History’s superpowers held their ground by maintaining the status quo without realizing that empires are fragile like domino towers, waiting for a finger to flick them off to misery.

The council should break itself from the status quo to redefine itself. Otherwise, it remains a pawn in the narrative it currently perpetuates.
