# About Me

I obtained my undergraduate degree in computer science during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fast forward to today, I am currently enrolled in the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program of the University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law. 

When granted the luxury of free time, I scramble to finish my video game backlogs. While creativity has oftentimes evaded me, I try to write a paragraph or two to keep the "frustrated-writer-flame" burning. Other interests of mine include data analysis and hoarding, journalism, Pok√©mon, and politics.
